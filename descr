## always conflict with camlp4

Trying to migrate away from camlp4?  This package will help
you by always conflicting with it!  Just try

    opam install no-camlp4 mypackage

and watch the solver tell you what is pulling in camlp4.

There is also an opam2 shell script that lists the packages
that have not yet been ported away from camlp4.  Just have an
opam2 installation and run `whats-left.sh` to get a GitHub
Markdown table.
